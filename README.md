## GD Clone

This is a simple Google Drive clone built using Laravel and VueJS via InteriaJS.

## NO MAINTENANCE

I have stopped working on this project because I don't have enough time, and hence, there won't be any further enhancements done to this project.

### Installation

Run the following command one-by-one

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MehulBawadia/google-drive-clone.git
cd google-drive-clone

composer install
npm install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan storage:link
php artisan serve --host=localhost
npm run dev
```
